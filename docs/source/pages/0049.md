# 49. Group Anagrams

## Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]]
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
``` 

**Constraints:**

- '1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- '0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- 'strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Intuition

Since the anagram can be in any order of alphabets, we need to sort them to keep track of an anagram. We need a dictionary of sorted words as key and anagrams as values.

### Approach

1. Loop over the strings and add each string to dictionary with sorted string as the key 
1. Return the values as list

### Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(n*x*log(x))`, where `x` is average length of strings
- Space complexity: `O(n)`

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        results = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            results[str(sorted(s))].append(s)
        return results.values()
```
